<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many file back-up services and cloud based storage services. This application is a peer-to-peer backup service which allows
you to create a synchronised directory across multiple machines which will update automatically when changes are made to the contents
of the directory.

This is more of a passion project than anything. I wouldn't recommend using this for anything important due to obvious security
flaws, at least not until I've implemented the correct encryption standards and fully tested the reliability of the application.
